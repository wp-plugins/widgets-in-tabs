Show all the widgets you love, forget about clutter.

== Description ==

Simple and elegant. WIT allows you to display all the widgets you love, without cluttering your site.


= How it works =

1. WIT adds a speical sidebar and a special widget. Let's call them WIT sidebar, and WIT widget.
2. The WIT sidebar is where you put all the widgets you love.
3. The WIT widget is what turns them into one tabbed, light and beautiful widget.

WIT sidebar is special, because it will not be displayed anywhere on your site. It's exclusively for WIT widget.
WIT widget is special, because you should never ever add it to WIT sidebar! Too much of special is just, well, too much!

= Features =

* **Adaptive Style**: Integrates seamlessly with professional themes. Choose the theme you love, and watch WIT dressing the same.
* **Unlimited Tabs**: Extra tabs are hidden behind a beatiful scrollbar. You can also display all tabs if you want.
* **Animations**: Animated, customizable, and sleek transition between widgets.
* **Customizable** Transitions: Be creative, and make your own transition recipe!
* **Automatic Transition**: Make the transition automatic with customizable interval.
* **User Friendly**: WIT is smart enough to never interrupt your visitors while they interact with it.
* **Shortcode**: Display WIT wherever you want, using the WIT shortcode. See FAQ for details.
* **Translation Ready**: RTL support and translation ready. It already has Arabic!
* **Multiple instances with different widgets**. You can add as many extra WIT areas as you want.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the WIT shortcode? =

Simply, type `[wit]` wherever you want WIT widget to appear inside your post or page. This will add a WIT instance with default options.

You can also use the WIT button for more options. Here are some examples:

* `[wit interval='0']`
* `[wit interval='3']`
* `[wit tab_style='scroll']`
* `[wit tab_style='show_all']`
* `[wit interval='3' tab_style='show_all']`

The interval attribute only accepts integer values that are equal to or larger than zero.
The tab_style attribute only accepts 'show_all' or 'scroll'.
If an inavlid value is provided, WIT will revert back to the default one.

**Important**

If you are using multiple WIT instances with the same area, you MUST specify a unique id for each instance to avoid invalid HTML on your blog, although WIT will attempt to avoid that anyways.
Example:

* `[wit area='my-special-wit' id='wit1']`
* `[wit area='my-speical-wit' id='wit2']`

= How to add extra WIT areas? =

Go to Dashboard -> Appearance -> WIT.
