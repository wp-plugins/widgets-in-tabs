= How it works =

WIT adds a special widgets area (sidebar) and a new widget.
This widgets area is special, because it will not appear anywhere in your site. It's just for the WIT plugin.
You can add as many widgets as you want to the special widgets area, just like any other widget area.
WIT widget will take all of those widgets, and turn them into one tabbed widget, light and beautiful.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use the WIT shortcode? =

Simply, type `[wit]` wherever you want WIT widget to appear inside your post or page. This will add a WIT instance with default options.

You can also use the WIT button for more options. Here are some examples:

* `[wit interval='0']`
* `[wit interval='3']`
* `[wit tab_style='scroll']`
* `[wit tab_style='show_all']`
* `[wit interval='3' tab_style='show_all']`

The interval attribute only accepts integer values that are equal to or larger than zero.
The tab_style attribute only accepts 'show_all' or 'scroll'.
If an inavlid value is provided, WIT will revert back to the default one.
